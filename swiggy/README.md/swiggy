# Swiggy SQL Analytics Project

Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end **SQL-based data modeling and analysis** using Swiggy food delivery data.  
The objective is to design a **star-schema data warehouse** and perform **business-driven analytical queries** to extract insights related to orders, revenue, dishes, and categories.

This project is built to showcase **SQL skills for Data Analytics / Business Analytics roles**.



## Database Design
The database follows a **star schema** with one fact table and multiple dimension tables.

### Fact Table
- **fact_swiggy_orders**
  - Stores transactional order-level data
  - Measures: `Price_INR`, `Rating`, `Order_Date`

### Dimension Tables
- **dim_date** – date-related attributes  
- **dim_location** – city and state details  
- **dim_restaurant** – restaurant information  
- **dim_category** – food categories  
- **dim_dish** – dish-level details  



## Entity Relationship (ER) Structure
- One **fact table** connected to multiple **dimension tables**
- Foreign keys link fact table to dimension tables
- Designed for efficient analytical queries



## Analytical Queries Included
This project answers key business questions such as:

- Total number of orders
- Total revenue generated
- Most ordered dishes
- Category-wise performance
- Average ratings by category
- Cuisine and restaurant performance analysis



## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server (SSMS)
- Relational Database Concepts
- Star Schema / Dimensional Modeling
